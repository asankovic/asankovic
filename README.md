### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹, 

my name is Alen, and I'm currently working as a Java/SAP CX developer at IBM iX.

I have finished [my master's](https://dabar.srce.hr/islandora/object/foi%3A7501) degree in informatics at Faculty of Organization and Informatics in VaraÅ¾din with my master's thesis about microservice architecture and it's implementation using Spring Cloud. This got me interested into microservices and in my free time, I'm trying to learn and expand my knoweledge even outside the Java world. 

I'm currently stepping into the JavaScript world and trying out things like Node.js, Typescript, and Nest.js, along with trying out Golang. You can find some of my progress on my GitHub profile [@asankovic](https://github.com/asankovic "My profile"). :v:
